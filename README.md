ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mikalai Holias.

I'm a beginner Python backend developer and a third-year Computer Science student at WSB Merito, majoring in Cloud Application Development. I am actively studying Computer Science and have gained in-depth knowledge of Python, FastAPI, and foundational skills in Docker and Git/GitHub. I also have experience in Linux server administration, specializing in managing VPN configurations and file storage solutions. Additionally, I have solved algorithmic problems, written SQL queries, and built simple CRUD web applications using FastAPI.
